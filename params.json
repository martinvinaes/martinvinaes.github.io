I recently visited the [Chair in Electoral Studies](http://www.chairelectoral.com/) at the University of Montreal. *** \r\n\r\nMy primary field of interest is in comparative political behavior, with a focus on electoral accountability and the quality of voter decision-making. In addition to this I am also interested in the role of information in EU elections. Some of my research is published or forthcoming in the *Political Science Research and Methods*, *Electoral Studies* and *Journal of Common Market Studies*, and has been featured in a number of Danish News mida outlets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to research I do a fair bit of writing on the intersection between policy and political science research. Primarily in Danish. Recently I have had op-eds in Berlingske, Politiken and Ræson.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinvinaes/martinvinaes.github.io/master/images/portrait.jpg\" width=\"150\"></center>\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"contact\"></a> Contact\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"research\"></a> Research\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"writing\"></a> Writing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
